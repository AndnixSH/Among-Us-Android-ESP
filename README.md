# Among Us Android ESP
A basic ESP for the game 'Among Us', made specifically for Android, and updated to v2022.4.19.

I made this a couple of months ago. It is a basic implementation of an ESP for Among Us, which uses ByNameModding, and shmoo's unity header. This source code will show you the basics of making an ESP from a monolist, and how to use static fields. 

The calculations were made specifically for 100% screen resolutions. If you use this, at least give the proper credits. Have fun!
